## Export as STL

<strong>Export as STL</strong> - interprets intensity in 2D image as height and writes the height surface in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29">STL format</a>. Data can be saved either in
    <samp>binary</samp> or <samp>ascii</samp> (text) format. Binary format produces much smaller files.
    Option <strong>Save sides</strong> enables generation of the mesh for sides and the bottom.

The plugins install under <tt>Plugins</tt> &gt; <tt>3D IO</tt> &gt; <tt>Export as STL</tt>menu.
