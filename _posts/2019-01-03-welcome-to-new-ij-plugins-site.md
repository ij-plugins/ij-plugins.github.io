The new IJ-Plugins site is staring its operation.

The IJ-Plugins project started in January of 2002 with mission of hosting plugins for [ImageJ][imagej]. It was originally hosted at [Source Forge](http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/). 

Source code for several projects ([ijp-toolkit](https://github.com/ij-plugins), [ijp-imageio](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-imageio), [ijp-scala-console](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-scala-console)) moved to GitHub some time ago. Some new projects ([ijp-color](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-color), [ijp-DeBayer2SX](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-DeBayer2SX)) were added on GitHub.

After a long wait [the original website](http://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/) is moving piece-by-piece to [this new location](http://ij-plugins.github.io/). It should be getting more regular updates here. Stay posted.
