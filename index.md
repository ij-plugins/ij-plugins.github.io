## Updates
* Mar 1, 2019 - the IJ-Plugins website started its transition from the [old location](https://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/) to here

## ImageJ Plugin Bundles and Libraries
* **[ijp-toolkit](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-toolkit)** - Set of ImageJ plugins and library for: reading and writing of 3D images, morphological operations on 3D images, color space conversion, color edge detection, various anisotropic diffusion filters, fast median filters, image quilting, image segmentation through clustering and region growing, and more.
* **[ijp-color](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-color)** - Operations on color spaces and color images, color conversion, and color calibration. 
* **[ijp-DeBayer2SX](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-DeBayer2SX)** - Bayer-pattern image to color image converters.
* **[ijp-scala-console](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-scala-console)** - edit and run Scala scripts from ImageJ, have full access to ImageJ API and API's of all installed plugins.
* **[ijp-imageio](https://github.com/ij-plugins/ijp-imageio)** - adds support for additional image file formats and sub-formats: BMP, FlashPIX, GIF, JPEG, PNG, PNM, and TIFF. Improves mapping of sample sizes, e.g., a 16 bit PNG or compressed TIFF images are read into ImageJ's ShortProcessor (16 bits per pixel). Enables reading and writing of 1 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, tiled, compressed, and multi-page TIFF images. The I/O operations are performed using JAI codec.

## Past Projects
For details see [the old website](https://ij-plugins.sourceforge.net/).

###  ImageJ Plugin Bundles and Libraries
* **ij-DCRaw** - open in ImageJ raw images from digital cameras with a help of DCRaw tool. Control how raw or how processed the opened image is.
* **ij-VTK** - The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and visualization written in C++ with bindings for Tcl/Tk, Java, Python, and .NET. ij-VTK provides plugins for running VTK image processing filters from ImageJ and helper classes for using VTK in Java applications.
* **MRIAnalysisPak** - is a plugin collection for ImageJ for the analysis of MRI and fMRI data. This package is maintained by members of the Center for Comparative Neuroimaging (CCNI) at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and The Small Animal MRI Laboratory at Harvard Medical School/Brigham & Women's Hospital. The MRIAnalysisPak can be downloaded here.

### VTK Examples for Java
* **VTK-Examples** - Port of Tcl and Python VTK examples to Java.
